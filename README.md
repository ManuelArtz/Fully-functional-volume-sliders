# Fully functional volume sliders
## Imagine this:
You made yourself some volume sliders. Great! But when you change the slider's value (visually), debug, swicth scenes and then come back to the scene with the sliders, you nitice that it resets to its original position. "How do I fix that?" you may ask. Well, here's a template project to understand how singletons can be implemented to store values!

## What is a "Singleton"?
According to the official Godot Documentation, it's a useful tool for solving the common use case where you need to store persistent information between scenes.

In simple terms: It's a script that stores variables, functions or other values that you can recall any time, on any script, for any scene!

## How do I make and use a Singleton?
This project is basically a form of tutorial so you can understand how singletons work. In this case scenario, you're gonna learn it in practice using volume sliders!
To get the most out of this template, use the code as a reference accordingly to the needs of your project.

_Do not copy and slam the entire project to yours and try to run it immediantly. It won't work and you'll look stupid by doing that. Seriously, the code ITSELF has a guide on what each thing does._
